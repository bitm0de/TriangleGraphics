# TriangleGraphics

This is a program that generates colors for each position in the output Sierpinski triangle of the specified size, from modular values derived from the triangle of binomial coefficients.

The idea behind this project was purely experimental to begin with, but as time progressed it became a more serious project, so I worked on this more than I initially planned. It was definitely one of my most memorable projects however. The results and the visual outputs from my testing were simply amazing to look at.
